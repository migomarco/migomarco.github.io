		<h1> Reading week 3 </h1>
		<p> What I learnt from this reading is that one should keep testing and redesign. When developing a progam or design any project infact, you need other prespectives, because at the end of the day you're designing for the people, so you have to see what the people like. Critiqing is so important for that reason. Also, sometimes you have to change ideas comepletely, or even the target audience changes, just depending on the development and where it leads, but that could go of track, and that is why you have to find the purpose of what it is you're designing.</p>
