      <h1>ASIANS IN ENGLISH</h1> 
      <br>
      <p>
      Asia is the most diverse continent in the world; not just in cuisine and sports, but also in languages, history, inventions, and cultures. To stop Asian hate, we must first understand where this hate comes from. Americans do not recognize Asian cultures accurately and tend to highlight the worst in each of them. However, it is not without reason: Americans are bombarded with stigmas and news depicting Asians in a negative or incorrect light.
      <br>
      <br>
      Americans tend apply a Chinese stigma to what they consider “Asian-looking” people. “Asian” has therefore become a term commonly used to describe an inaccurate Chinese depiction, disregarding all other Asian cultures. Often, Americans find it hard to even recognize their own biases—that’s where the problem starts.
      <br>
      <br>
      We must educate Americans on who Asians truly are, and highlight the problem on how they are viewed in America. Using Google Images, the most widely used search engine, we can see
      how Americans view Asians vs how Asians see themselves
      and want to be recognized.
