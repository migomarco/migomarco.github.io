      <h1>ASIAN AMERICAN & PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH</h1> 
      <br>
       <p>
        Asia is the most diverse continent in the world, rich in a vast array of languages, histories, cultures, and innovations. Yet, for many Americans, this diversity is overshadowed by limited and often negative portrayals, especially after the rise in anti-Asian violence in the U.S. following COVID-19. The recent surge in targeting Asians has highlighted how little Americans understand about Asian and Pacific Islander communities, often grouping all “Asian-looking” people under a narrow, stereotyped “Chinese” identity that disregards the unique cultures within Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage.
        <br>
        <br>
        To stop anti-Asian hate, we must understand its roots. Stigmatizing media and misinformation have led to biases that many Americans don’t even recognize within themselves. The challenge lies in educating Americans on the full diversity of Asian cultures and addressing harmful perceptions that reduce Asian identity to monolithic and inaccurate images. By comparing how Asians are portrayed in U.S. media with how they see themselves, we can create a more accurate and respectful understanding of AAPI communities, helping to foster empathy, respect, and lasting change.

               <p>
              Asia is the most diverse continent, yet in the U.S., this diversity is often reduced to narrow stereotypes, especially with the rise in anti-Asian violence since COVID-19. Many Americans lump all “Asian-looking” people under a single, often negative identity, overlooking the rich cultures within Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage. To combat anti-Asian hate, we must educate Americans on the true diversity of Asian cultures and challenge harmful perceptions, building a more accurate and respectful understanding of AAPI communities.
